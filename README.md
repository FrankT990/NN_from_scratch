# Neural Network From Scratch - Frank Tittiger

## About
This project implements an application for designing, training, and testing customizable neural networks on datasets of images for the purpose of multi-class classification. 
## Instructions to run
1). Compile C++ files

2). Run App.py with Python

Note: the files json.hpp and stb_image.h are third party files that I did not create. 
## Functionality
This project was designed specifically for datasets containing images (preferably greyscale png files). Training is done locally and hence may take a long time for neural networks with many nodes (layers > 3, nodes > 32).
## Demo

See demo.mp4 for demo of implementing a neural network for the minst digit dataset. (Note: low accuracy of prediction is due to the low amount of nodes chosen for each layer to make training fast enough for a demo video)
